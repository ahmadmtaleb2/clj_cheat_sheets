# Functions dictionary 
it is a document that group all the functions that I encountered so far
- You can derive new functions from existing functions in the same way that you derive new data from existing data

## filter 
- a seq function  
- The filter function takes two arguments: 
    1. a predicate function (f) and 
    2. a sequence (s). 
- Filter returns a new sequence consisting of all the items of s for which (f item) returns true.
- Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.
- pred must be free of side-effects.
> (filter pred)     (filter pred coll)
>
> (filter #(> % 5) '(3 4 5 6 7)) => output: (6 7)
>
>(filter even? (range 10)) => output: (0 2 4 6 8)
>
> (filter (fn [x] (= (count x) 1)) ["a" "aa" "lisp" "clojure" "q" ""]) => output: ("a" "q")
>


## some
- Returns the first logical true value of (pred x) for any x in coll, else nil.  
- One common idiom is to use a set as pred, for example
this will return :fred if :fred is in the sequence, otherwise nil:
> (some #{:fred} coll)
>
> (some pred coll)
>
> (some even? (1 2 3 4))        => output: true
>
> (some even? '(1 3 5 7))       => output: nil
>
> (def values [0 1 2 3 4 5 6])
>
> (some #(and (< % 6) %) values)        => output: 0
>
> (some #(and (> % 6) %) values)        => output: nil
>
> (some #(and (< % 3) %) values)        => output: 0 // we are using and in order to show the value from values that evaluates the predicate function of some to true => so as a result, some will not return true or false instead it will returns the value 


## sort
- it sorts elements in ascending order 
- Returns a sorted sequence of the items in coll. 
- If no comparator is supplied, uses compare.
- comparator must implement java.util.Comparator
- Guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will not be reordered.
- If coll is a Java array, it will be modified.  To avoid this, sort a copy of the array.

> (sort coll)       (sort comp coll)
>
> (sort [3 1 2 4])      => output: (1 2 3 4)
>
> (sort > (vals {:foo 5, :bar 2, :baz 10}))     => output: (10 5 2)
>


## sort-by
- allows you to apply a function (sometimes called a key function) to the elements of a sequence and use the values it returns to determine the sort order.
- Returns a sorted sequence of the items in coll, where the sort order is determined by comparing (keyfn item). 
- If no comparator is supplied, uses compare. 
- comparator must implement java.util.Comparator. Guaranteed to be stable: 
- equal elements will not be reordered.
- If coll is a Java array, it will be modified. To
avoid this, sort a copy of the array.
> (sort-by keyfn coll)      (sort-by keyfn comp coll)
>
> (sort-by count ["aaa" "bb" "c"])      => output: ("c" "bb" "aaa")
>
> (sort-by first [[1 2] [2 2] [2 3]])       => output: ([1 2] [2 2] [2 3])
>
> (sort-by first > [[1 2] [2 2] [2 3]])     => output: ([2 2] [2 3] [1 2])
>


## concat
- concat simply appends the members of one sequence to the end of another
- Returns a lazy seq representing the concatenation of the elements in the supplied colls.
> (concat [1 2] [3 4])      => output: (1 2 3 4)
>
> (into [] (concat [1 2] [3 4]))        => output: [1 2 3 4]
>
> (concat [:a :b] nil [1 [2 3] 4])      => output: (:a :b 1 [2 3] 4)
>
> (concat "abc" "def")      => output: (\a \b \c \d \e \f)


## count  
- Returns the number of items in the collection. 
- (count nil) returns 0.
- Also works on strings, arrays, and Java Collections and Maps
> (count coll)
> 
> (count nil) => output: 0
>
> (count []) => output: 0
> (count [1 2 3]) => output: 3
>
> (count {:one 1 :two 2}) => output: 2
>
> (count [1 \a "string" [1 2] {:foo :bar}]) => output: 5
> 
> (count "string") => output: 6


## dec 
- Returns a number one less than x. 
- Does not auto-promote longs, will throw on overflow
> (dec x)
>
> (dec 2) => output: 1
>
> (dec 2.0) => output: 1.0
>
> (dec 1) => output: 0
>
> (dec -1)  => output: -2


## nth
- Returns the value at the index. 
- get returns nil if index out of bounds, 
- nth throws an exception unless not-found is supplied.
- nth also works for strings, Java arrays, regex Matchers and Lists, and, in O(n) time, for sequences.
> (nth coll index) **OR** (nth coll index not-found)
>
> (nth ["a" "b" "c" "d"] 0) => output: "a"
>
> (nth ["a" "b" "c" "d"] 1) => output: "b"
>
> (nth [] 0) => output: IndexOutOfBoundsException
>
> (nth [] 0 "nothing found") => output: "nothing found"
>
> (nth [0 1 2] 77 1337) => output: 1337


## inc 
- **inc** function increments a number by 1
>(inc 1.1) => output: 2.1


## identity  
- the identity function returns the argument it's given without altering it.
> (identity 4) => output: 4


## take
- a seq function 
- it takes two arguments:
    1. a number n
    2. a collection coll
- Returns a lazy **sequence** of the first n items in coll
- or all items if there are fewer than n.
- Returns a stateful transducer **()** when no collection is provided.
- 
> (take n) **OR** (take n coll)
>
> (take 3 '(1 2 3 4 5)) => output: (1 2 3)
>
> (take 3 [1 2]) => output: (1 2) returns all items if there are fewer than n
>
> (take 1 []) => output: ()
>
> (take 1 nil) => output: ()
>
> (take 0 [1]) => output: ()
>
> (take -1 [1]) => output: ()


## take-while
- a seq function 
- it takes a predicate funtion => **pred** => a function whose return value is evaluated for truth or flasity to determine when it should stop taking.
-  Returns a lazy sequence of successive items from coll **while** (pred item) returns logical **true**. 
- pred must be free of side-effects.
- Returns a transducer when no collection is provided.
- When take-while start, if the anonymous function reaches an entry that returns false => take-while returns a sequence of every element it tested
until that point and if it is the first element it will return a transducer **()**.

> (take-while pred) **OR** (take-while pred coll)
>
> (def months [{:month 1 :name "january"} {:month 2 :name "february"} {:month 3 :name "march"} {:month 4 :name "april"} {:month 5 :name "may"} {:month 6 :name "juin"} {:month 7 :name "july"} {:month 8 :name "august"} {:month 9 :name "september"} {:month 10 :name "october"} {:month 11 :name "november"} {:month 12 :name "december"}])
>
> (take-while #(> (:month %) 3) months)     => output: () // the first month is 1, it is less than 3 so the function is ealuated to false so it didn't continue 
>
> (take-while #(< (:month %) 3) months)     => output: ({:month 1, :name "january"} {:month 2, :name "february"})
>
> (take-while #(= (rem (:month %) 3) 1) months)     => output: ({:month 1 :name "january"})
>
> (take-while #(= (rem (:month %) 3) 0) months)     => output: ()
>
> (take-while #(= (rem (:month %) 2) 1) months)     => output: ({:month 1 :name "january"})
>
> (take-while #(= (rem (:month %) 2) 0) months)     => output: ()


## drop 
- a seq function 
- it take two arguments:
    1. a number n
    2. a collection coll
- Returns a lazy sequence with the first n items in coll **removed**
- Returns a stateful transducer **()** when no collection is provided.
> (drop n) **OR** (drop n coll)
> 
> (drop -1 [1 2 3 4]) => output: (1 2 3 4) `negative (or zero) drop-item-counts are accepted they do nothing`
>
> (drop 0 [1 2 3 4]) => output: (1 2 3 4) 
>
> (drop 2 [1 2 3 4]) => output: (3 4)
>
> (drop 5 [1 2 3 4]) => output: () `dropping more items than are present is allowed, and all items are dropped`


## drop-while
- a seq function 
- the same ideas that applies to take-while applies to drop-while 
- BUT it keeps dropping elements until the test return false (in the pred function)
- Returns a lazy sequence of the items in coll starting from the first item for which (pred item) returns logical false.  Returns a
stateful transducer when no collection is provided.
> (drop-while pred)     (drop-while pred coll)
>
> (drop-while neg? [-1 -2 -3 1 -2 4 6 7 8 9 -1])        => output: (1 -2 4 6 7 8 9 -1)
>
> (drop-while #(> 3 %) [1 2 3 4 5 6])       => output: (3 4 5 6)
>
> (drop-while #(> 3 %) [5 3 1 2 3 4 5 6])       => output: (5 3 1 2 3 4 5 6)
>


## into
- on of the most important collection functions 
- you can use it to convert the return value of seq functions back into the original data structure
- Returns a new coll consisting of to-coll with all of the items of from-coll conjoined. 
- A transducer may be supplied.
- both arguments can be the same type or different
- add the element in the from to the element in to
> (into *to* *from*)
>
> (into [] (set [:a :a])) => output: [:a] 
>
> (into {} (map identity {:sunlight-reaction "Glitter!"}))      => output: {:sunlight-reaction "Glitter!"}


## loop
- loop defines bindings
- recur **re-executes** loop with new bindings
> (loop [i 0]
    (if(< i 10)
        (recur (inc i))
        i))
- On the first pass through the loop, i has a value of 0. Next, it checks the value of i. If the value is less than 10 we recur . Itâ€™s as if loop creates an anonymous function with a parameter named i , and recur allows you to call the function from within itself, passing the argument (inc i).


## re-find
- re-find checks whether a string matches the pattern described by a regular expression
- it returns the **matched text** or **nil** if there is no match
> (re-find #"^left-" "left-eye") => output: "left-"
> (re-find #"^left-" "wongleblart")) => output: nill


## empty?
- Returns true if **coll** has no items 
> (empty? coll)
>
> (empty? ()) => output: true
>
> (empty? []) => output: true
>
> (empty? {}) => output: true
>
> (empty? "") => output: true
>
> (empty? nil) => output: true


## expand (form)
- didn't find this one 


## first, second and last
- All Clojure collections support sequencing. You can operate on sequences with functions like first, second, and last.

>
> (= 3 (second [2 3 4])) => output: true
>
> (= 3 (last (list 1 2 3))) => output: true


## rest
- The rest function will return all the items of a sequence except the first.
> (= [20 30 40] (rest[10 20 30 40]))


## seq 
- find it in the sequences file


# rem
- remainder of dividing numerator by denominator.
> (rem num div)


## odd
- Returns true if n is odd, 
- throws an exception if n is not an integer
> (odd? n)
>

>
> (odd? 2)      => output: false
>
> (odd? 0)      => output: false


## even
- Returns true if n is even, 
- throws an exception if n is not an integer

>
> (even? 1)      => output: false
>
> (even? 2)      => output: true
>
> (even? 0)      => output: true


## range
- it returns a lazy seq of nums from start (**inclusive**) to end (**exclusive**), by step, where start defaults to 0, step to 1, and end to infinity.
- When step is equal to 0, returns an infinite sequence of start. 
- When start is equal to end, returns empty list.
> (range)
>
> (range end)
>
> (range start end)
>
> (range start end step)
>
> (range 10)        => output: (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
>
> (range -5 5)      => output: (-5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4)
>
> (range 0 6 2)     => output: (0 2 4)
>
> (range 100 0 -10)     => output: (100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10)


## time 
- Evaluates expr and prints the time it took.  Returns the value of expr.
> (time expression)
> 
> (time (concat '(1 2) '(3 4)))     => output: "Elapsed time: 0.066739 msecs"  (1 2 3 4)


## repeat
- creates a sequence whose every member is the argument you pass
- Returns a lazy (infinite!, or length n if supplied) sequence of xs.
> (repeat x)    (repeat n x)
>
> (take 5 (repeat "x"))     => ("x" "x" "x" "x" "x")
>
> (concat (take 8 (repeat "na")) ["Batman!"])       => output: ("na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "Batman!")


## repeatedly
- Takes a function of no args, presumably with side effects, and returns an infinite (or length n if supplied) lazy sequence of calls to it
> (repeatedly f)    (repeatedly n f)
>
> (repeatedly 10 (fn [] (rand-int 10)))     => output: (9 1 5 3 6 4 3 4 0 3)
>
> (take 10 (repeatedly (fn [] (rand-int 10))))      => output: (6 4 2 8 5 8 5 2 6 9)


## cons
- Returns a new seq where x is the first element and seq is the rest.
- Lisp programmers call it consing when they use the cons function.
> (cons 1 '(2 3 4 5 6))     => output: (1 2 3 4 5 6)


## apply
- apply explodes a seqable data structure so it can be passed to a function that expects a rest parameter.
> (apply max [0 1 2])       => output: 2


## partial
- partial takes a function and any number of arguments. It then returns a new function. When you call the returned function, it calls the original function with the original arguments you supplied it along with the new arguments.
- In general, you want to use partials when you find youâ€™re repeating the same combination of function and arguments in many different contexts.
> (def add10 (partial +10))
>
> (add10 3)     => output: 13
> 
> (def add-missing-elements (partial conj ["water" "earth" "air"]))
>
> (add-missing-elements "sand" "sea")       => ouput: ["water" "earth" "air" "sand" "sea"]


## complement
- Takes a fn f and returns a fn that takes the same arguments as f, has the same effects, if any, and returns the opposite truth value.
> (complement f)
**need an implementation to it for better understanding**


## reverse
- Returns a seq of the items in coll in reverse order
- Not lazy.

>
> (apply str (reverse "clojure"))       => output: "erujolc"
>


## rseq
- Returns, in constant time, a seq of the items in rev (which can be a vector or sorted-map), in reverse order
- If rev is empty returns nil
> (rseq rev)
>
> (vec (range 10))      => output: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
> 
> (rseq (vec (range 10)))       => output: [9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0]


## every?
- Returns true if (pred x) is logical true for every x in coll, else false.
> (every? pred coll)
>
> (every? even? '(2 4 6))       => output: true
>
> (every? even? '(1 2 3))       => output: false
>
> (every? #{1 2} [1 2 3])       => output: false  //you can use every? with a set as the predicate to return true if every member of a collection is in the set
>
> (every? #{1 2} [1 2])     => output: true
>


## pos?
- returns true if num is greater than zero

>
> (cons [1 2] [4 5 6])      => output: [[1 2] 4 5 6]
>
> 


## rest
- Returns a possibly empty seq of the items after the first. Calls seq on its argument.
> (rest coll)
>
> (rest [1 2 3 4 5])        => output: [2 3 4 5]
>
> (rest ["a" "b" "c"])      => output: ["b" "c"]
>
> (rest '())        => output: ()
>
> (rest nil)        => output: ()


## dissoc
- dissoc[iate]. Returns a new map of the same (hashed/sorted) type, that does not contain a mapping for key(s).
> (dissoc map)  (dissoc map key)    (dissoc map key & ks)
>
> (dissoc {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})     => output: {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}  // dissoc nothing 
>
> (dissoc {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :b)      output: => {:a 1, :c 3}  // dissoc key :b
>
>(dissoc {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :d)       => output: {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3} // dissoc not existing key
>
> (dissoc {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :c :b)       => output: {:a 1} // several keys at once

## comp
- used for creating a function from the composition of any number of functions 
- Takes a set of functions and returns a fn that is the composition of those fns.  
- The returned fn takes a variable number of args, applies the rightmost of fns to the args, the next fn (right-to-left) to the result, etc.
- using math notation => using **comp** on the functions f1 f2 f3 ... fn creates a new function g such as g(x1, x2, x3, ....xn) = f1(f2(fn(x1, x2, ....xn)))
- **NOTE** the first function applied (the last function in comp = fn) can take any number of arguments, whereas the remaining functions must be able to take only one argument 
- f one of the functions you want to compose needs to take more than one argument => You wrap it in an anonymous function.
- Cojure's comp function can compose any number of functions

> (comp)    (comp f)    (comp f g)  (comp f g & fs)
>
> (def foo (comp inc *))        //we are creating an anonyous function by composing the inc and * functions 
> (foo 2 3)     => output: 7  // foo function is applied took the two args 2 and 3 => foo first multiplies the numbers 2 and 3 and then increments the result by 1


## memoize
- memoize functions so that Clojure remembers the result of a particular function call
- Memoization lets you take advantage of referential transparency by storing the arguments passed to a function and the return value of the function. That way, subsequent calls to the function with the same arguments can return the result immediately.
- Returns a memoized version of a referentially transparent function. 
- The memoized version of the function keeps a cache of the mapping from arguments to results and, when calls with the same arguments are repeated often, has higher performance at the expense of higher memory use.
- This implementation could be useful for functions that are computationally intensive or that make network requests.

> (memoize f)
>
> (defn sleepy-id
    "returns the given value after 1 sec"
    [x]
    (Thread/sleep 1000) x)
> (time (sleepy-id "Mr. Fantastico"))       => output: "Mr. Fantastico"  // elapsed time: 1000.34 msecs  // every call to sleepy-id for the same argument will take 1000 msecs to be evaluated 
> (def memo-sleepy-id (memoize sleepy-id))  // we create a new memoized version of sleepy-id
>
> (time (memo-sleepy-id "Mr. Fantastico"))       => output: "Mr. Fantastico"  // elapsed time: 1000.615 msecs  // only the first call will waits one second
>
> (time (sleepy-id "Mr. Fantastico"))       => output: "Mr. Fantastico"  // elapsed time: 0.038 msecs  // every subsequent functionc all return immediately
